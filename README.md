# Customer-Churn-Prediction

In order to gather information about both churning and non-churning customers, this project will analyse data from the Telco Customer Churn dataset using Python and associated tools.

Customer churn refers to the possibility that a customer has moved to a competitor's product and ceased using the original product. We may utilise data analysis to find prospective features and create client retention plans in order to stop customers from churning. It is also mentioned that keeping an existing, devoted customer is simpler and less likely to result in customer turnover than trying to acquire new ones.

Objective
"Predict behavior to retain customers. I will be analyzing all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs."
