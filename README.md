# Customer-Churn-Prediction

"The ChurnPredictor repository focuses on predicting customer churn, which refers to the likelihood of a customer moving to a competitor’s product. This project is particularly relevant for telecommunications firms, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. 

The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict which customers are likely to churn, allowing businesses to adjust their strategies accordingly.

The project involves analyzing all relevant customer data and developing focused customer retention programs. The model will forecast the likelihood of a customer’s churn based on an analysis of three key features: (1) demographic data, (2) account data, and (3) service data. The ultimate goal is to lower churn rates, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and company revenue.

The steps of the project include data reading, exploratory data analysis and data cleaning, data visualization, feature importance and engineering, splitting the data into training and testing sets, assessing multiple algorithms, selecting the Gradient Boosting algorithm, evaluating the performance of the model, and drawing conclusions."
