# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Customer churn refers to the possibility that a customer has moved to a competitor's product and ceased using the original product. 

Business Problem
Telecommunications firms need to be able to predict customer turnover in order to efficiently retain consumers. Getting new clients is more expensive than keeping the old ones. Large telecom companies are therefore working to create models that will allow them to identify which of their customers are most likely to change and adjust their strategies accordingly.

It is desirable to develop a machine learning model that can predict customers who will leave the company, to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.

Objective
"Predict behaviour to retain customers. I will be analyzing all relevant customer data and developing focused customer retention programs."
In this project, I will develop a model to forecast the likelihood of a customer's churn based on an analysis of three key features: (1) demographic data, (2) account data, and (3) service data. The goal is to come up with a data-driven solution that will enable us to lower churn rates, which will raise customer happiness and company income.
